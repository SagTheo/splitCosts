- implement debt functionality
        --> who owes how much to who
                --> implement more advanced update functionality 
                    (if user already owes another one, take that into account when updating the debt)
                        --> needs more work: bug when removing an expense
                            --> use individual totals to figure out who owes what to who
                                    -> function should be fired everytime an expense is added or removed

--> amount input: format to a proper number (if user adds a 0 at the beginning for example)
