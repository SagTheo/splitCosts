- implement debt functionality
        --> who owes how much to who
                --> implement more advanced update functionality 
                    (if user already owes another one, take that into account when updating the debt)


--> control on amount input: amount has to be > 0

--> handle decimal numbers in DebtItem -> write formatNumber function in functions.js
